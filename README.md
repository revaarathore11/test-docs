# Workflow Clinic

Workflow Clinic is a GSoC 2026 project focused on improving the portability, reproducibility, and cloud-readiness of scientific workflows.

The project aims to analyze workflow languages such as Nextflow and Snakemake, convert them into a common intermediate representation called **WorkflowBundle**, and identify workflow portability issues through automated validation and analysis.

By using a common workflow model inspired by the DAW (Data Analysis Workflow) metamodel, Workflow Clinic can reason about workflows independently of their original language and provide consistent diagnostics, recommendations, and future repair capabilities.

## Why Workflow Clinic?

Scientific workflows are often tightly coupled to specific execution environments, storage systems, schedulers, or local infrastructure.

This can make workflows difficult to:

- Share
- Reproduce
- Port across platforms
- Execute in cloud environments
- Integrate with GA4GH-compliant services

Workflow Clinic aims to help workflow authors identify and resolve these issues before deployment.
